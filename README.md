`Social Network With Using Geo-information Technology`

### My application was created to add a game element to our journeys. My social network allows user to create his own map, which will display the places visited by him, as well as share this information with other users, thereby exchanging experience between travelers.

The goal of each user is to visit as many places as possible in order to unlock the remaining sectors and fill the map. 

The division of the map into sectors and the processing of intersection of sectors are implemented using a binary search algorithm and an algorithm for solving the problem of belonging a point to a polygon with ray tracing.
